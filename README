File-OSS-Scan version 0.01

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This module allows you to scan your project directory based on a set of pre-defined
but also customizable rules, to detect all the used source files that originate from
OSS ( or commercial software ).

DEPENDENCIES
------------
This module requires Cache::FileCache for persistence of previous matching results.

INSTALLATION
------------
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

(I'd be lying if I said there was a real test suite at the moment...)
